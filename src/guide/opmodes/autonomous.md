# Autonomous

Creating an autonomous in NextFTC is fairly straightforward. This page will walk
you through creating an autonomous. Usage of PedroPathing will not be covered in
this page; refer to the [PedroPathing page](/guide/opmodes/pedropathing)for
details on that.

This autonomous program will introduce you to some core features of NextFTC such
as command groups, delays, and running the commands you created in your
subsystems.

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create your OpMode

OpModes in NextFTC will extend the `NextFTCOpMode` superclass. Here is the basic
structure for every autonomous OpMode:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Kotlin")
class AutonomousProgram : NextFTCOpMode() {

}
```

== Java

```java
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Java")
public class AutonomousProgram extends NextFTCOpMode {

}
```

:::

That's not all, though. We want our autonomous program to use the lift and claw
subsystems we created in
the [subsystems guide](/guide/subsystems/overview). To do that, we need to
add a `SubsystemComponent` to our OpMode.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
init {
    addComponents(
        SubsystemComponent(Lift, Claw)
    )
}
```

== Java

```java
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Java")
public class AutonomousProgram extends NextFTCOpMode {
    {
        addComponents(
            new SubsystemComponent(Lift.INSTANCE, Claw.INSTANCE)
        );
    }
}
```

:::

This will tell NextFTC that we will be using those subsystems in this OpMode,
and will initialize them accordingly.

### A Quick Note on Components

Components are NextFTC's approach to making OpModes more modular and
customizable. Each component has 10 functions that
get run before and after each OpMode function (`onInit`, `onWaitForStart`,
`onStartButtonPressed`, `onUpdate`, and
`onStop`). This means that components are extremely versatile and can be used to
accomplish a wide range of
functions when they're used in your OpModes.

We already have used a component: `SubsystemComponent`! Let's add one more
component to our OpMode:
`BulkReadComponent`. This component automatically adds bulk reading to our
OpMode.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
init {
    addComponents(
        SubsystemComponent(Lift, Claw),
        BulkReadComponent()
    )
}
```

== Java

```java
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Java")
public class AutonomousProgram extends NextFTCOpMode {
   
    // if you've never seen this before, it's called an instance initialization block, or IIB.
    {
        addComponents(
            new SubsystemComponent(Lift.INSTANCE, Claw.INSTANCE),
            new BulkReadComponent()
        );
    }
}
```

:::

## Step 2: Creating a routine

You've already learned how to create individual commands, such as motor and
servo movements. Now, it's time to group
them together into useful behaviors. This is where `CommandGroups` and routines
come into play. Before we can create our
own, we first need to understand how commands are run behind the scenes.

The `CommandManager` stores an internal list of actively running commands. It
goes through each command and calls its
`update()` function every single loop. It also determines which commands to
cancel, handles subsystem conflicts, and
offers additional functionality as well. The important thing to note is that all
commands that are directly stored by
the CommandManager run _simultaneously_. Knowing that, you may be wondering why
`ParallelGroups` exist, if you can just
schedule commands directly. Trust me, we'll get there. Before that, we need to
understand what a `SequentialGroup` does.

A `SequentialGroup` stores a collection of commands and runs them _in a row_.
Instead of scheduling all of its children
at once, it schedules the first one, and then waits to schedule the next one
until the first has completed, then
continues scheduling them one by one until they've all completed. If you think
about it a little bit, it may become
apparent what a `ParallelGroup` is for. If you are using a `SequentialGroup`,
you may have things you want to happen
simultaneously _within_ that group. For example:

1. Drive to a location
2. _Simultaneously_ raise a lift and rotate an arm
3. Open a claw
4. _Simultaneously_ lower the lift, reset the arm, and drive to a different
   location

This could only be accomplished using `ParallelGroups` in conjunction with
`SequentialGroups`.

Now that we know what `CommandGroups` do, let's learn how to create them. For
this example, we will create a routine that
does the following:

1. Raise the lift to the high position
2. _Simultaneously_ open the claw and move the lift to the middle position
3. Wait for half a second
4. _Simultaneously_ close the claw and move the lift to the low position

This routine is unlikely to actually be useful in an autonomous program, but it
will introduce you to the mental
processes behind creating commands, and will give you the tools you need to
create your own. Let's go ahead and create
our command.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup()
```

== Java

```java
public Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup();
}
```

:::

I've made an empty SequentialGroup here, for demonstration purposes.

As mentioned above, we need to put something in our sequential group in order to
avoid errors. In our list, we said the
first thing we want to do is raise the lift to the high position. We can add the
`Lift.toHigh` command into our group
very easily:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup(
        Lift.toHigh
    )
```

== Java

```java
public Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup(
            Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh
    );
}
```

:::

The next thing we wanted to do is _simultaneously_ open the claw and move the
lift to the middle position. To add
another command to the group, add a comma at the end of your last item (in this
case, `Lift.toHigh`) and add the next
command on a new line (before the close parenthesis). In this case, we want to
add a `ParallelGroup` because we want to
do things simultaneously next.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup(
        Lift.toHigh,
        ParallelGroup()
    )
```

== Java

```java
public Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup(
            Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh,
            new ParallelGroup()
    );
}
```

:::

Just like with `SequentialGroups`, you shouldn't create empty `ParallelGroups`.
Let's populate it with our
`Lift.toMiddle` and `Claw.close` commands:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup(
        Lift.toHigh,
        ParallelGroup(
            Lift.toMiddle,
            Claw.close
        )
    )
```

== Java

```java
public Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup(
            Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh,
            new ParallelGroup(
                    Lift.INSTANCE.toMiddle,
                    Claw.INSTANCE.close
            )
    );
}
```

:::

Since command groups are also just commands, we can just continue to add
commands after the ParallelGroup. Let's wait
for half a second using a `Delay` command. That takes a single value, the amount
of time to delay in seconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]

Let's create our delay:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup(
        Lift.toHigh,
        ParallelGroup(
            Lift.toMiddle,
            Claw.close
        ),
        Delay(0.5.sec)
    )
```

== Java

```java
public Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup(
            Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh,
            new ParallelGroup(
                    Lift.INSTANCE.toMiddle,
                    Claw.INSTANCE.close
            ),
            new Delay(0.5)
    );
}
```

:::

Finally, we can add our last `ParallelGroup` to our routine. The final routine
looks like this:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
private val autonomousRoutine: Command
    get() = SequentialGroup(
        Lift.toHigh,
        ParallelGroup(
            Lift.toMiddle,
            Claw.close
        ),
        Delay(0.5.sec),
        ParallelGroup(
            Claw.open,
            Lift.toLow
        )
    )
```

== Java

```java
private Command autonomousRoutine() {
    return new SequentialGroup(
            Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh,
            new ParallelGroup(
                    Lift.INSTANCE.toMiddle,
                    Claw.INSTANCE.close
            ),
            new Delay(0.5),
            new ParallelGroup(
                    Claw.INSTANCE.open,
                    Lift.INSTANCE.toLow
            )
    );
}
```

:::

## Step 3: Running our routine

Now that we have our routine, we just need to run it. To do this, let's override
the `onStartButtonPressed()` function.

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

To schedule a command, you can either call
`CommandManager.scheduleCommand(commandToAdd)`, or you can just do
`commandToAdd()`. In this case, let's do the latter.

```kotlin
override fun onStartButtonPressed() {
    autonomousRoutine()
}
```

== Java

To schedule a command, you can either call
`CommandManager.INSTANCE.scheduleCommand(commandToAdd())`, or you can just do
`commandToAdd().schedule()`. In this case, let's do the latter.

```java
@Override
public void onStartButtonPressed() {
    autonomousRoutine().schedule();
}
```

## Final result

That's it! You have created your very first autonomous program and, perhaps more
importantly, learned about some of the
tools you have at your disposal to create more complex autonomous programs.

Here is the final result:

:::tabs key:code

== Kotlin

```kotlin
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Kotlin")
class AutonomousProgram : NextFTCOpMode() {
    init {
        addComponents(
            SubsystemComponent(Lift, Claw),
            BulkReadComponent()
        )
    }

    private val autonomousRoutine: Command
        get() = SequentialGroup(
            Lift.toHigh,
            ParallelGroup(
                Lift.toMiddle,
                Claw.close
            ),
            Delay(0.5.sec),
            ParallelGroup(
                Claw.open,
                Lift.toLow
            )
        )

    override fun onStartButtonPressed() {
        autonomousRoutine()
    }
}
```

== Java

```java
@Autonomous(name = "NextFTC Autonomous Program Java")
public class AutonomousProgram extends NextFTCOpMode {
    {
        addComponents(
            new SubsystemComponent(Lift.INSTANCE, Claw.INSTANCE),
            new BulkReadComponent()
        );
    }

    private Command autonomousRoutine() {
        return new SequentialGroup(
                Lift.INSTANCE.toHigh,
                new ParallelGroup(
                        Lift.INSTANCE.toMiddle,
                        Claw.INSTANCE.close
                ),
                new Delay(0.5),
                new ParallelGroup(
                        Claw.INSTANCE.open,
                        Lift.INSTANCE.toLow
                )
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void onStartButtonPressed() {
        autonomousRoutine().schedule();
    }
}
```
