# NextBindings

NextBindings is our callback bindings library. It supports binding callbacks
to buttons, rising and falling edge detection, automatic gamepad polling, and
even joystick curving!

## Installation

In the `build.dependencies.gradle` file, go to the `dependencies` block.
Add the following lines to the bottom:

::: tabs key:gradle

== .gradle

```groovy
implementation 'dev.nextftc:bindings:1.0.1'
```

== .gradle.kts

```kotlin
implementation("dev.nextftc:bindings:1.0.1")
```

:::

Then, press the `Sync Now` button that appeared as a banner at the top of your
Gradle
file.

*You're good to go!*
